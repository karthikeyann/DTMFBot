DTMF Bot
========
 Control a robot using Audio port via computer or mobile (connect audio/earphone port to robot)
 
 This is one of the cheapest way to add remote control to robot very fast. 

The Robot contains a DTMF decoder. Its output is connected to simple decoder or a MCU (in this case PIC MCU) which inturn is connected to L293D (DC motor controller).

Using this you can control the robot using DTMF codes via computer or mobile phone. or even via mobile phone call.
You need to connect the audio out from computer or mobilephone to DFTMF audio input. If you need to call and control the bot via another mobile, you need to put the phone in auto answer mode.

For using my program, download Autohotkey and run script bot.ahk with autohotkey.

Up/Down/Left/Right arrows are used to create 4 DTMF sounds which will control the robot.
This project was done during my B.tech for College TechFest Anokha.
